## Brazil recipe measurement converter

Though there are similarities with both U.S. and European units, the units of measurement used in Brazil are different, causing confusion when trying to convert recipes. 

This app aims to address that problem by enabling users to convert between Brazilian recipe measurements and U.S. / metric units of volume. (Other measurements to be added in the future.)

The user can toggle between English and Portuguese text.

Now get cooking!
